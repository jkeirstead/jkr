#' jkr
#'
#' This package provides convenient access to functions and variables
#' that I commonly use for R analysis.  By putting these functions
#' into their own package, it becomes easier to share code rather than
#' passing around customized .Rprofile files and I can still
#' automatically load everything but with a simpler
#' \code{library(jkr)} call.
